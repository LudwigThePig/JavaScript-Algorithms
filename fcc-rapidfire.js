Directions:
    Compare two arrays and return a new array with any items only found in one of the two given arrays, but not both. In other words, return the symmetric difference of the two arrays.

APPROACH:
  Concat the the two arrays

        filter will remove items that are is arr1 or arr2
  Chain those methods together and return
